# Processing Template

A template which can be used to work with Processing.

- I have added the files `comepile.sh` and `run.sh` which can be used to *compile* (using `javac`) and *run* (using `java`) the `.java` files in `src` folder. The **main class** is `Application.java`.  
- The output of `javac` is saved in the `bin` folder.  
- `.jar` files can be added to the project by putting them in the `lib` folder.
